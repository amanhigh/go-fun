# Memcached Operatior

## Description
This is a Trial K8 Controller Project to learn about it. Tutorial Followed can be found [here](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/). For Operatior Golang has been used which gives most flexibility.

## Setup

Steps followed
* **Init** -  Domain is used for group CRD and Repo is used for Golang Module Management (go.mod generation). Add Generated Module to Go Work File.\
`operator-sdk init --domain aman.com --repo github.com/amanhigh/go-fun/components/operator`\
`go work use ./components/operator/`

* **Controller** - Generate Controller and Types. Type/API will be *MemCached* with Version *v1alpha1* available under group *cache.aman.com*. Generated Go Files are under ./api, ./controllers and  ./config has yaml files.\
`operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --resource --controller`

* **Image Plugin** - Helps to control Docker File. Command Guides Creation of Docker file with image, command, user specifications.  This Generates [Controller](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/latest/testdata/go/v3/memcached-operator/controllers/memcached_controller.go), Type Specs and its Test. \
`operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --plugins="deploy-image/v1-alpha" --image=memcached:1.4.36-alpine --image-container-command="memcached,-m=64,modern,-v" --run-as-user="1001"`

* **Models** - Made Model Modification (ContainerPort addition) and do autogeneration. Updated [Spec](config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml) to include *containerPort: 8443*\
`make generate`

* **Manifests** - Generate Manifests CRD (cache.aman.com_memcacheds.yaml), RBAC(role.yml).\
 `make manifests`

* **Docker** - Updated Docker Base Image & [File](./Dockerfile). Fixed Image Name (amanfdk/operator) in Make File.\
`make docker-build docker-push`\
`docker images`

## Deployment
Project can be run in following ways

### Outside Cluster
Run `make install run` to run without cluster.

### On cluster
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster which can be local (kind/minikube) or remote. 

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

#### --Setup--
1. Deploy Operator: Operator is deployed in *operator-system* Namespace.\
`make deploy`

2. Install Instances (Current Namespace) of Custom Resources:\
`kubectl apply -f config/samples/`

#### --Cleanup--
1. To delete the CRDs from the cluster:  `make uninstall`
2. UnDeploy the controller to the cluster: `make undeploy`

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
